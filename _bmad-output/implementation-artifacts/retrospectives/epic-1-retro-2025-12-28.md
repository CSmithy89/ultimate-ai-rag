## What Went Well

1. **Clean execution** - All 4 stories completed without blockers
2. **AI code reviews** - CodeRabbit and Gemini caught real issues:
   - Backend app export fix
   - Config validation hardening
   - Docker volume mount issues
   - Dependency pinning
3. **Review feedback loop** - All 10 review items addressed before merge
4. **Documentation** - READMEs, CLAUDE.md, and epic docs all created

---

## Challenges & Learnings

1. **Docker build context** - Frontend Dockerfile needed root context for pnpm lockfile
2. **Node modules in Docker** - Volume mount was overwriting container node_modules
3. **Config validation** - BACKEND_PORT needed explicit int conversion with error handling

---

## Technical Debt Deferred

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Dependabot for npm + pip | Low | Automated dependency updates |
| CodeQL security scanning | Medium | GitHub security integration |
| Backend healthcheck curl/wget | Low | Requires adding to image |
| DB/Redis client wiring | High | Needed for Epic 2 |

---

## Epic 2 Preparation

### Dependencies on Epic 1 (All Met ✅)
- FastAPI backend running
- Agno v2.3.21 installed
- PostgreSQL + Neo4j + Redis via Docker
- Environment configuration working

### Preparation Needed
1. **Wire database clients** - Postgres, Neo4j, Redis connections
2. **Review Agno patterns** - Orchestrator agent setup
3. **Trajectory schema** - Design for persisting agent thoughts

### Potential Concerns
- No test infrastructure yet
- Backend structure may need alignment with architecture spec

---

## Action Items

| Action | Owner | Priority |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Wire DB clients (Postgres, Neo4j, Redis) | Dev | Critical |
| Add basic test infrastructure | Dev | High |
| Add Dependabot | DevOps | Low |
| Add CodeQL scanning | DevOps | Medium |

---

## Next Steps

1. Complete DB client wiring before Epic 2 stories
2. Begin Epic 2 with Story 2-1: Orchestrator Agent Foundation
3. Add test coverage as agents are built
