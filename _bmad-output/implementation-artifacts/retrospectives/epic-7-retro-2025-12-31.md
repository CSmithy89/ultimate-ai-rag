# Epic 7 Retrospective

Date: 2025-12-31
Epic: 7 - Protocol Integration & Extensibility

## Participants
- Chris (Project Lead)
- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Winston (Architect)
- Paige (Tech Writer)

## Epic Summary
- Stories completed: 4/4 (7-1 through 7-4)
- Scope delivered: MCP tool discovery/invocation, A2A collaboration sessions, Python SDK, universal AG-UI endpoint
- Additional hardening: consistent tenant validation, rate limiting with Retry-After, tool timeouts, A2A cleanup, RFC 7807 error responses
- Story points/velocity: Not tracked in story records
- Production incidents: None recorded in story records

## Successes and Strengths
- Protocol surface area is clean and consistent (registry + endpoints + SDK).
- Multi-tenant isolation and rate limiting enforced across new endpoints.
- Strong test coverage with unit and integration tests for MCP, A2A, and AG-UI.
- Post-review hardening added resiliency (timeouts, validation, cleanup tasks).

## Challenges and Growth Areas
- A2A sessions are in-memory and ephemeral; persistence strategy remains open.
- Observability metrics for MCP/A2A/AG-UI are not implemented yet.
- Documentation needs a stronger developer-facing narrative beyond README snippets.

## Key Insights and Lessons Learned
- Centralizing validation rules reduces drift and avoids inconsistent checks.
- Tight review loops uncovered important hardening work that should be planned early.
- Integration tests are essential for protocol workflows and should be first-class.

## Previous Retro Follow-Through (Epic 6)
- Protocol compliance checklist: Partially applied, no explicit checklist artifact created.
- Story dev notes + test sections: Completed in Epic 7 story files.
- Documentation updates (AG-UI/HITL): Partially addressed; still room for a dedicated doc page.
- Tech debt from Epic 6 (HITL persistence, share/bookmark persistence, PDF export decision): Not addressed.

## Next Epic Preview
- Epic 8 details were not found in the output epic files.
- Sprint status indicates Epic 8 (Operations & Observability) is next.
- Action: load the planning artifact and formalize an epic file in `_bmad-output` before kickoff.

## Action Items
1. Decide A2A session persistence strategy (in-memory vs Redis) and document the decision.
   Owner: Winston + Charlie
2. Define observability metrics and collection plan for MCP, A2A, and AG-UI.
   Owner: Winston + Dana
3. Add a protocol compliance checklist to the story or PR workflow.
   Owner: Bob
4. Expand end-to-end tests for AG-UI streaming and MCP flows across the API boundary.
   Owner: Dana + Amelia
5. Track Epic 6 tech debt items (HITL persistence, share/bookmark persistence, PDF export decision) in the backlog.
   Owner: Alice + Charlie
6. Create a focused SDK usage doc (errors, retries, examples) beyond README snippets.
   Owner: Paige

## Preparation Tasks for Next Epic
- Create a formal Epic 8 file in `_bmad-output` with scope and success criteria.
- Align observability requirements with product goals before story creation.
- Confirm data retention and privacy constraints for telemetry.

## Critical Path Items
- Finalize observability requirements and metrics coverage.
- Decide and document A2A persistence strategy.
- Confirm Epic 8 scope and success criteria before kickoff.

## Readiness Assessment
- Testing & Quality: Strong unit/integration coverage; end-to-end coverage remains limited.
- Deployment: Status not recorded in story files; confirm release state.
- Stakeholder Acceptance: Not recorded; confirm sign-off.
- Technical Health: Stable, with known gaps around persistence and observability.
- Blockers: None, contingent on completing critical path items above.

## Commitments and Next Steps
- Action items: 6
- Preparation tasks: 3
- Critical path items: 3

We will review these commitments in the next standup and verify ownership before starting Epic 8.
