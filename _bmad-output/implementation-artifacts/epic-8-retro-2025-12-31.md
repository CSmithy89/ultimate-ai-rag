# Epic 8 Retrospective

Date: 2025-12-31
Epic: 8 - Operations & Observability

## Participants
- Chris (Project Lead)
- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Winston (Architect)
- Paige (Tech Writer)

## Epic Summary
- Stories completed: 4/4 (8-1 through 8-4) per sprint status
- Scope delivered (per sprint status): LLM cost monitoring, intelligent model routing, trajectory debugging, encrypted trace storage
- Documentation gap: no Epic 8 story files found in implementation artifacts
- Story points/velocity: Not tracked (story files unavailable)
- Production incidents: None recorded

## Successes and Strengths
- Sprint status indicates Epic 8 delivered all planned stories.
- Observability focus aligns with architectural requirements for cost and trajectory tracking.

## Challenges and Growth Areas
- Missing story files prevents evidence-based review of implementation details.
- No recorded dev notes, testing outcomes, or review feedback for Epic 8.
- Observability work still needs public-facing documentation and usage guidance.

## Key Insights and Lessons Learned
- Retrospectives depend on story artifacts; missing files create blind spots.
- Observability epics should include explicit metrics and dashboards in story acceptance criteria.

## Previous Retro Follow-Through (Epic 7)
- A2A persistence strategy: Not documented as addressed.
- Observability metrics plan: Not documented as addressed.
- Protocol compliance checklist: Not documented as created.
- SDK usage docs beyond README: Not documented as created.
- Epic 6 tech debt tracking: Not documented as updated.

## Next Epic Preview
- Epic 9 is not defined in the output artifacts.
- Recommendation: define Epic 9 before kickoff, and ensure story files are generated for evidence-driven retros.

## Action Items
1. Backfill Epic 8 story files or move them into implementation artifacts for traceability.
   Owner: Bob + Charlie
2. Document observability metrics, dashboards, and retention policies.
   Owner: Winston + Paige
3. Create a protocol compliance checklist for new routes and tools.
   Owner: Bob
4. Add a short Epic 8 validation report (tests run, quality gates, and key metrics).
   Owner: Dana
5. Track Epic 6 tech debt items in the backlog with owners and priority.
   Owner: Alice + Charlie

## Preparation Tasks for Next Epic
- Create Epic 9 definition in `_bmad-output` with scope and success criteria.
- Confirm data privacy and retention constraints for telemetry.
- Establish baseline operational dashboards or reporting endpoints.

## Critical Path Items
- Resolve Epic 8 documentation gap (story files or summary report).
- Define Epic 9 scope and acceptance criteria.
- Align observability requirements with product goals.

## Readiness Assessment
- Testing & Quality: Not verifiable due to missing story artifacts.
- Deployment: Not recorded in story files.
- Stakeholder Acceptance: Not recorded.
- Technical Health: Observability delivered per sprint status, but supporting docs are missing.
- Blockers: Documentation gaps and undefined Epic 9 scope.

## Commitments and Next Steps
- Action items: 5
- Preparation tasks: 3
- Critical path items: 3

We will revisit this retrospective once Epic 8 story artifacts are available.
