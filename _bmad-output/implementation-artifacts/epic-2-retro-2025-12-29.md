**Date:** 2025-12-29
**Facilitator:** Bob (Scrum Master)
**Epic Status:** COMPLETE ✅

---

## Epic Summary

| Metric | Result |
|------|--------|
| Stories Completed | 4/4 (100%) |
| Core Deliverables | Orchestrator agent, multi-step planning, retrieval selection, trajectory logging |
| Reviews | All story reviews APPROVED |
| Tests | 15 total, 12 passed, 3 skipped (DB/Redis dependent) |

## Participants

- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Chris (Project Lead)
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Dana (QA Engineer)

## What Went Well

1. Execution felt fast and smooth once the foundations were in place.
2. Review cycles surfaced real quality improvements that strengthened the foundation.
3. Core agentic capabilities landed cleanly across all four stories.

---

## Challenges & Surprises

1. Review and change cycles were the primary friction.
2. Some review-driven fixes arrived late in the epic, creating extra rework.

---

## Key Learnings

1. Review-driven fixes are valuable enough to standardize across future epics.
2. Capturing these standards early will reduce review churn later.

## Previous Retro Follow-Through (Epic 1)

**Action Items from Epic 1:**
- Wire DB clients (Postgres, Neo4j, Redis) — ✅ Completed
- Add basic test infrastructure — ✅ Completed
- Add Dependabot — ❌ Not addressed
- Add CodeQL scanning — ❌ Not addressed

**Continuity Insights:**
- The high-impact items (DB + tests) directly improved Epic 2 velocity.
- Tooling hygiene (Dependabot/CodeQL) remains an open risk.

---

## Readiness Assessment

- Testing & Quality: ✅ Core suite run; Redis rate-limit test not exercised
- Deployment: ✅ Scheduled; no blockers
- Stakeholder Acceptance: ✅ Confirmed
- Technical Health: ✅ Stable
- Unresolved Blockers: ✅ None reported

---

## Action Items

| Action | Owner | Priority |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Define review-driven standards for future epics/stories (multi-tenancy, async DB I/O, pooling, request envelope, validation, rate limiting, tests) | Dev | High |
| Add a story template rule: each story must state which standards are already satisfied and which will be implemented | Dev | Medium |

## Preparation Tasks for Next Epic

- None required yet (Epic 3 not defined in output artifacts)

---

## Critical Path Items

- None identified

---

## Closing Notes

Epic 2 delivered the agentic reasoning foundation with strong quality improvements driven by reviews. The next priority is to codify those improvements as explicit standards so future epics require fewer review cycles.
