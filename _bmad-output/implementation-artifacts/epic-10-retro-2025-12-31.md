# Epic 10 Retrospective - Testing Infrastructure

Date: 2025-12-31

## Epic Summary
- Epic: 10 - Testing Infrastructure
- Status: Complete (7/7 stories)
- Scope delivered: integration test framework, protocol E2E coverage, benchmarks, and testing documentation

## Team Participants
- Chris (Project Lead)
- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Elena (Junior Dev)
- Winston (Architect)

## Delivery Metrics
- Completion: 7/7 stories (100%)
- Story points: Not tracked
- Velocity: Not tracked
- Blockers encountered: 0
- Technical debt items tracked: 3 follow-ups captured
- Test coverage notes: integration + benchmarks added; coverage metrics not captured here
- Production incidents: 0 (no production changes)

## Successes and Strengths
- Real service integration framework with tenant isolation and cleanup standardized across tests.
- Protocol E2E coverage added for MCP, A2A, and AG-UI flows.
- Benchmarks introduced with JSONL result recording and CI hooks.
- Testing docs now include skip inventory and follow-up tracking.

## Challenges and Growth Areas
- Integration tests require external services and env gating, which adds setup friction.
- Graphiti E2E coverage depends on external credentials; CI does not cover those paths.
- Skipped tests still require dedicated CI coverage or local profile guidance.

## Key Insights and Lessons Learned
- Tenant-isolated fixtures reduce cross-test flakiness and should be a hard standard.
- Clear skip reasons + a centralized skip inventory reduce confusion for QA and devs.
- Separating integration/benchmark jobs keeps default CI fast and predictable.

## Story Record Patterns (Epic 10)
- Reuse of integration fixtures and gating patterns across most stories.
- Review feedback consistently emphasized safe cleanup and explicit skip reasons.
- Benchmark results are captured in JSONL for trend visibility.

## Previous Retro Follow-Through (Epic 9)
- No Epic 9 retrospective found; no carryover action items to validate.

## Next Epic Preview
- Epic 11 is not defined in planning artifacts; readiness items are listed below.

## Action Items
### Process Improvements
1. Create an integration test checklist/template (gating, tenant isolation, cleanup, skip reasons)
   - Owner: Bob (Scrum Master)
   - Timeline: Before Epic 11 kickoff
   - Success criteria: Template added to docs/testing and referenced in story template

2. Document local test profiles (unit vs integration vs benchmark) with quickstart steps
   - Owner: Paige (Technical Writer)
   - Timeline: Next planning checkpoint
   - Success criteria: docs/testing/README.md updated

### Technical Debt
1. Add a dedicated CI job for Redis-backed rate limit tests
   - Owner: Dana (QA Engineer)
   - Priority: High
   - Effort: TBD

2. Run migrations in integration CI to cover tenant isolation tests
   - Owner: Charlie (Senior Dev)
   - Priority: Medium
   - Effort: TBD

### Documentation
1. Add README pointer to testing docs and benchmark results path
   - Owner: Paige (Technical Writer)
   - Timeline: Next doc update

## Team Agreements
- Always gate integration/benchmark tests with explicit env flags and skip reasons.
- All integration tests must use tenant isolation + cleanup fixtures.
- Benchmarks must record results to JSONL for trend visibility.

## Preparation Tasks (for upcoming epic once defined)
- Define Epic 11 scope and dependencies with explicit testing prerequisites.
- Implement Redis rate-limit CI job (aligns with skip follow-up list).
- Add migration step to integration CI to cover tenant isolation tests.

## Critical Path Items
1. Define Epic 11 scope + dependencies
   - Owner: Alice (Product Owner)
2. Add Redis rate-limit CI job
   - Owner: Dana (QA Engineer)

## Significant Discoveries
- None identified that require an epic plan change.

## Readiness Assessment
- Testing & Quality: Ready (tests pass; integration gated; benchmarks optional)
- Deployment: Not applicable (no production changes)
- Stakeholder acceptance: Internal acceptance complete
- Technical health: Stable
- Unresolved blockers: None

## Commitments and Next Steps
- Track action items in the next planning checkpoint and weekly standup.
- Confirm Epic 11 scope before starting new stories.
- Close testing infra gaps to eliminate remaining skips.
