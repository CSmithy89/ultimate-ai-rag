## Epic Summary

| Metric | Result |
|------|--------|
| Stories Completed | 4/4 (100%) |
| Core Deliverables | Vector search, graph traversal, hybrid synthesis, graph explainability |
| Reviews | All story reviews APPROVED |
| Tests | Test outcomes not fully captured in story records; follow-up actions listed below |

## What Went Well

1. Modular retrieval services landed cleanly (vector, graph, hybrid synthesis), with clear responsibilities.
2. Evidence payloads (vector citations + graph nodes/edges/paths) improved explainability and trust.
3. Tenant isolation was consistently enforced in graph queries.
4. Deterministic prompt construction made behavior more predictable and testable.

---

## Challenges & Surprises

1. Review-driven fixes surfaced late in the epic and created follow-up rework.
2. Story records did not capture enough implementation challenges or testing gaps, making retrospective analysis harder.
3. Test validation revealed environment-related blockers and incomplete coverage for critical retrieval paths.

---

## Key Learnings

1. Review-driven standards need to be codified early, not retrofitted after story completion.
2. Retrieval work benefits from strict validation and test harnesses to avoid hidden data integrity issues.
3. Story documentation must include explicit challenges and test outcomes to prevent blind spots in retrospectives.

---

## Patterns from Story Analysis

**Success Patterns:**
- Hybrid retrieval design was consistent across stories, with clear evidence boundaries.
- Orchestrator integration consistently routed retrieval output into prompt building.

**Review Patterns:**
- Most review feedback focused on correctness, validation, and maintainability.
- Tenant isolation and deterministic behavior were recurring quality priorities.

**Testing & Quality Patterns:**
- Testing detail was not consistently recorded in story files.

## Previous Retro Follow-Through (Epic 2)

**Action Items from Epic 2:**
- Define review-driven standards for future stories — ❌ Not addressed
- Update story templates to capture standards coverage — ❌ Not addressed

**Continuity Insights:**
- Lack of early standards contributed to late review fixes in Epic 3.
- Story templates still need a standards coverage section to reduce review churn.

---

## Readiness Assessment

- Testing & Quality: ⚠️ Partial; retrieval tests exist but end-to-end validation needs a stable test harness
- Deployment: Not documented
- Stakeholder Acceptance: Not documented
- Technical Health: ✅ Stable with follow-up tasks identified
- Unresolved Blockers: ✅ None reported

## Action Items

| Action | Owner | Priority | Success Criteria |
|--------|-------|----------|------------------|
| Codify retrieval review checklist (multi-tenancy, validation, timeouts, caching, evidence) | Charlie (Senior Dev) | High | Checklist applied to all new retrieval changes |
| Update story template to include standards coverage section | Bob (Scrum Master) | High | New template used in next story creation |
| Add integration tests for hybrid retrieval evidence path | Dana (QA Engineer) | High | Test verifies combined vector + graph evidence output |
| Document retrieval configuration (limits, caching, timeouts) | Paige (Tech Writer) | Medium | Doc published and linked from README |
| Add troubleshooting notes for graph traversal edge mismatches | Paige (Tech Writer) | Medium | Troubleshooting section available in docs |

---

## Preparation Tasks for Next Epic

- None formally defined (next epic spec not available in output artifacts).

---

## Critical Path Items

- Establish stable test harness for retrieval integration tests before next epic kickoff.

---

## Closing Notes

Epic 3 delivered the hybrid retrieval foundation with strong explainability gains. The primary improvement area is earlier enforcement of review standards and tighter test documentation. With these action items in place, the next epic can build on this foundation with fewer late-cycle corrections.
