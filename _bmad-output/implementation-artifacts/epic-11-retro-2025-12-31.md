# Epic 11 Retrospective - Code Cleanup & Migration

Date: 2025-12-31

## Epic Summary
- Epic: 11 - Code Cleanup & Migration
- Status: Complete (9/9 stories)
- Scope delivered: legacy module removal, Graphiti migration tooling and flag removal, HITL wiring, workspace persistence, HTML parsing upgrade, Neo4j pooling, embedding token monitoring, A2A session persistence
- PR: https://github.com/CSmithy89/ultimate-ai-rag/pull/12 (open, mergeable)

## Team Participants
- Chris (Project Lead)
- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Elena (Junior Dev)
- Winston (Architect)
- Paige (Technical Writer)

## Delivery Metrics
- Completion: 9/9 stories (100%)
- Story points: Not tracked
- Velocity: Not tracked
- Blockers encountered: 0 reported
- Technical debt items tracked: 5 follow-ups captured
- Test coverage notes: full test gate run (backend + frontend), 12 skips remain per environment-gated tests
- Production incidents: 0 reported

## Successes and Strengths
- Removal of legacy indexing modules reduced surface area and clarified Graphiti-first flow.
- HITL validation now persists checkpoints and emits AG-UI events end-to-end.
- Workspace persistence moved from in-memory to durable Postgres storage with share/bookmark flows.
- Infrastructure improvements (Neo4j pooling, A2A Redis persistence) improved runtime stability.
- HTML parsing is now library-based and more robust.

## Challenges and Growth Areas
- Several stories recorded tests and docs as planned-but-not-run/updated; alignment improved only at epic gate.
- Graphiti migration script exists but requires real environment execution and validation.
- Documentation for new persistence and protocol behavior remains incomplete.

## Key Insights and Lessons Learned
- Consolidating legacy paths is safer when paired with an explicit migration runbook and validation checklist.
- Persistence features (HITL, workspace, A2A) are interconnected; they benefit from shared Redis/Postgres observability patterns.
- Late-stage test gate caught issues efficiently, but earlier test execution would reduce rework.

## Story Record Patterns (Epic 11)
- Multiple stories noted “tests updated but not run,” indicating a recurring gap in local verification.
- Documentation updates were frequently marked as planned, suggesting a need for a doc-closeout ritual at story completion.
- Infrastructure changes consistently required configuration documentation and test harness tweaks.

## Previous Retro Follow-Through (Epic 10)
Action items from Epic 10 retro:
- Integration test checklist/template: Not completed
- Local test profiles documentation: Not completed (follow-up still listed)
- Redis rate-limit CI job: Not completed
- Integration CI migration step: Not completed
- README pointer to testing docs: Not completed

## Next Epic Preview
- Epic 12 is present in sprint status as "Documentation & DevOps" but no epic planning document was found in output artifacts.
- This epic should absorb documentation follow-ups from Epic 11 and Epic 10 testing gaps.

## Action Items
### Process Improvements
1. Add a story-level “test execution + doc update” closeout checklist.
   - Owner: Bob (Scrum Master)
   - Success criteria: Story template updated and enforced in reviews

2. Reintroduce the Epic 10 testing follow-ups into Epic 12 scope (checklist, local profiles, CI coverage).
   - Owner: Alice (Product Owner)
   - Success criteria: Stories created in Epic 12

### Technical Debt / Risk Reduction
1. Run Graphiti migration on a real environment and validate entity/relationship counts per tenant.
   - Owner: Charlie (Senior Dev)
   - Success criteria: Migration report documented with counts and backup location

2. Add observability notes for HITL checkpoints, workspace persistence, and A2A session state.
   - Owner: Dana (QA Engineer)
   - Success criteria: Ops runbook entries added

### Documentation
1. Document HITL endpoint behavior, A2A persistence, workspace persistence, and embedding usage tracking.
   - Owner: Paige (Technical Writer)
   - Success criteria: docs updated and linked from README

## Team Agreements
- All persistence changes must include a minimal ops note in the same PR.
- Stories touching infra/config must include a verification note for tests and configuration docs.
- Graphiti migration will not be considered “done” until a real run is documented.

## Preparation Tasks (for Epic 12)
- Promote Epic 11 doc follow-ups into Epic 12 backlog.
- Capture testing follow-ups from Epic 10 as explicit Epic 12 stories.
- Create a migration validation checklist for Graphiti before Epic 12 kickoff.

## Critical Path Items
1. Execute Graphiti migration in a real environment and document results.
2. Complete documentation updates for new persistence and protocol behavior.
3. Establish testing checklist and local test profile guidance.

## Significant Discoveries
- No critical discoveries requiring an epic plan change, but migration execution remains a gating risk.

## Readiness Assessment
- Testing & Quality: Ready (tests, type-check, lint pass; environment-gated skips remain)
- Deployment: Not recorded; confirm release status before next epic kickoff
- Stakeholder acceptance: Internal acceptance implied; formal sign-off not documented
- Technical health: Stable; migration execution still pending
- Unresolved blockers: None, but migration run is a critical prerequisite

## Commitments and Next Steps
- Track action items in the next planning checkpoint.
- Update Epic 12 scope to include doc/testing follow-ups.
- Complete migration execution and documentation before Epic 12 kickoff.
