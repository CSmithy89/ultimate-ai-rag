# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - contexted: Epic tech spec completed, ready for story execution
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder
#   - ready-for-dev: Story context generated
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)

  # Epic 13: Enterprise Ingestion
  # DECISION (2026-01-04): Current crawler.py does NOT use installed Crawl4AI library!
  # Must migrate from custom httpx to AsyncWebCrawler for JS rendering + parallel crawling
  # See: docs/epics/epic-13-tech-spec.md
  #
  # CARRY-FORWARD FROM EPIC 12 CODE REVIEW (2026-01-04):
  # - HIGH: Add full retrieval pipeline integration test (rerank + grade + fallback)
  # - HIGH: Add multi-tenancy enforcement tests with tenant_id assertions
  # - MEDIUM: Make CrossEncoderGrader selectable via GRADER_MODEL env var
  # - MEDIUM: Make heuristic content length weight configurable
  # - LOW: Add contextual retrieval cost logging (token usage)

  # Epic 16: DEPRECATED - Merged into Epic 17
  # ==========================================
  # DECISION (2026-01-05): Party Mode analysis revealed that PydanticAI, CrewAI,
  # and LangGraph all have NATIVE A2A + MCP support. Internal framework adapters
  # are NOT needed. Adopted "Vision A: RAG as Service" approach.
  #
  # What was kept from Epic 16 (moved to Epic 17):
  # - Story 16-4 → 17-6: Agent Skills for Anthropic ecosystem
  # - Framework templates → 17-5: Starter templates for each framework
  # - Protocol docs → 17-7: Protocol integration guide
  #
  # What was removed (not needed - native protocol support exists):
  # - 16-1: Headless agent protocol interface
  # - 16-2: PydanticAI adapter (native A2A + MCP)
  # - 16-3: CrewAI adapter (native A2A + MCP)
  # - 16-5: LangGraph adapter (native A2A + MCP)
